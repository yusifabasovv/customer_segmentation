# customer_segmentation

### In this repesitory , I built a customer clustering (K-means ) model to group them into 4 parts :

**1.Loyal customers**  
**2.New customers**  
**3.You can't lose them**  
**4.Lost costumers**  

**The dataset contains 3 columns : sifarisci (customer id), tarix (sale date) and satis (sales amount in AZN)**
